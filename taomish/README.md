## Fully functional web application fullstack project

This project is a part of my personal portfolio and is designed to accumulate and demonstrate 
technical stack that I have learned throughout my coding journey.

It is a fully complete and functional example of online bookstore library and shop. 
User can browse through various web app pages in order to search for books, 
checkout books, leave reviews and ratings and so on.];;;;;;
Design of the website is completely done by me as well as the book covers design etc.
